# cvon-ai.training

This repository contains sample projects to initialize deep learning projects, using pytorch deep learning network:
- Classification, a project containing basic code for training a classification model
- Other project types (such as segmentation) to be added in a later stage

The classification project is modeled conform the [cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project template. This project structure was developed to initiate a standard, reproducable and sharable data science project structure.
